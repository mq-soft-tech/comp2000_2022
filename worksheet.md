Clone this repository (well done!)

# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?
  *  - Both are services that integrate VCS systems. Neither GitHub or BitBucket can objectively be better than the other. Two comparable points that could be used to distinguish the better per use cases is: The supported VCS systems. BitBucket supports Mercurial, whereas github does not. Github does overcome this by supporting Git which is the more commonly used VCS. Git Does supports notably more integrations than BitBucket. And also has a few more quality of life features.
  * Who made the last commit to repository A?
  * - Matthew roberts
  * Who made the first commit to repository A?
  * - Jon Mountjoy
  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?
  * First and last commits were made by Davepearce.
  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?
  *  - Both projects are still active. Although slow.
  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?
  * - Repo A has the most activity on `app.py`
  * - Repo B has the most activity on the build file build.num. Else it is `src/wyjc/io/ClassFileBuilder.java`

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints

Red vs. Blue
